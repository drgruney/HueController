# HueController
An Arduino compatible controller for Philips Hue Lights with SmartThings integration.


Next thing is to try and figure out why I get delayed response when triggering groups vs. individual lamps. The lights may turn on at trigger, but off (or if several commands are sent in quick succession) is usually delayed.
